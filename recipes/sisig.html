        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Sisig is a popular Filipino dish known for its sizzling presentation and bold, tangy flavors. Traditionally made from parts of pig head and liver, it's now often prepared with pork belly for ease and availability. The meat is marinated in a mixture of vinegar, soy sauce, and calamansi (a citrus fruit native to the Philippines), then grilled and chopped into fine pieces. It's usually served on a hot iron plate, creating a delightful sizzle when brought to the table, and is often garnished with raw onions, chili, and sometimes a raw egg that cooks in the residual heat.</p>
        <p>This dish is a perfect balance of savory, tangy, and spicy flavors. The crispy and chewy textures of the meat, combined with the zingy citrus and heat from the chilies, make sisig a favorite among locals and food enthusiasts alike. It is often enjoyed as an appetizer or a main course, typically accompanied with rice.</p>
