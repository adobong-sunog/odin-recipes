            <h3>Description</h3>
            <p>Tapsilog is a beloved Filipino breakfast dish, a portmanteau of its main components: "tapa" (cured beef), "sinangag" (garlic fried rice), and "itlog" (fried egg). This hearty meal is often enjoyed to start the day with a burst of savory flavors. The beef is marinated in a sweet and tangy mix of soy sauce, garlic, vinegar, and sugar, then fried to perfection. Paired with aromatic garlic rice and a sunny-side-up egg, tapsilog offers a delightful combination of textures and tastes.</p>
            <p>This dish is not just for breakfast; it is enjoyed at any time of the day, often served with a side of atchara (pickled papaya) and a dipping sauce of vinegar with chili and garlic. The rich, savory flavors of the beef, the comforting garlic rice, and the creamy yolk of the fried egg make tapsilog a versatile and satisfying meal.</p>
